Ontologies are widely used for representing domain knowledge and meta
data, playing an increasingly important role in Information Systems,
the Semantic Web, Bioinformatics and many other domains. However,
logical reasoning that ontologies can directly support are quite
limited in learning, approximation and prediction. One straightforward
solution is to integrate statistical analysis and machine learning. To
this end, automatically learning vector representation for knowledge
of an ontology i.e., ontology embedding has been widely investigated
in recent years. Numerous papers have been published on ontology
embedding, but a lack of systematic reviews hinders researchers from
gaining a comprehensive understanding of this field. To bridge this
gap, we write this survey paper, which first introduces different
kinds of semantics of ontologies, and formally defines ontology
embedding from the perspectives of both mathematics and machine
learning, as well as its property of faithfulness. Based on this, it
systematically categorises and analyses a relatively complete set of
over 80 papers, according to the ontologies and semantics that they
aim at, and their technical solutions including geometric modeling,
sequence modeling and graph propagation. This survey also introduces
the applications of ontology embedding in ontology engineering,
machine learning augmentation and life sciences, presents a new
library mOWL, and discusses the challenges and future directions.
