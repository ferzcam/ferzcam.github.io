Life sciences have a long history of driving advancements in various
disciplines, including mathematics, philosophy, and logic. In recent
years, life sciences have also become a significant application area
for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including for
neuro-symbolic AI methods. The life sciences knowledge infrastructure,
characterized by its widespread use of ontologies, complex annotation
models, large size, and community standards, presents unique
challenges and opportunities for neuro-symbolic AI. We outline how
neuro-symbolic methods have been applied and developed to address
these challenges. We describe semantic similarity measures, knowledge
graph embeddings, ontology embeddings, and knowledge-enhanced learning
in the context of formalized life science knowledge. While there has
been significant progress, we also outline multiple remaining
challenges that provide opportunities for future research.
