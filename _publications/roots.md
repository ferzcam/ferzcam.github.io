The main objective of this work has been to implement a model to find
equidistant real roots using a Successive Adaptive Linear Neural
Modeling which uses two approaches: a Self Organized Map (SOM) and an
Adaptative Linear Neuron (Adaline). A SOM model has been used with a
new neighborhood function Λ, and a physical distance β with which the
task is divided in sub-processes reducing the complexity of the task
because the SOM model can delimited the areas where a single root
exist. Then, through a successive approach, it is applied an
Feed-forward neural model with a learning process base on Adaline
neuron with pocket in each pair of regions for finding the real root
values with a reduced precision. Finally, several experiments were
done consider CPU time, relative error, distance between the roots and
polynomial degrees. The results show that the time complexity grows in
a linear or logarithmic way. Also, the error does not increase in a
higher rate than the degree of polynomial or the root distance.
