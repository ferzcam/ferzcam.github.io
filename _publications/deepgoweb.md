Understanding the functions of proteins is crucial to understand
biological processes on a molecular level. Many more protein sequences
are available than can be investigated experimentally. DeepGOPlus is a
protein function prediction method based on deep learning and sequence
similarity. DeepGOWeb makes the prediction model available through a
website, an API, and through the SPARQL query language for
interoperability with databases that rely on Semantic Web
technologies. DeepGOWeb provides accurate and fast predictions and
ensures that predicted functions are consistent with the Gene
Ontology; it can provide predictions for any protein and any function
in Gene Ontology. DeepGOWeb is freely available at
