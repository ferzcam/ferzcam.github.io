**Motivation** Ontologies contain formal and structured information
about a domain and are widely used in bioinformatics for annotation
and integration of data. Several methods use ontologies to provide
background knowledge in machine learning tasks, which is of particular
importance in bioinformatics. These methods rely on a set of common
primitives that are not readily available in a software library; a
library providing these primitives would facilitate the use of current
machine learning methods with ontologies and the development of novel
methods for other ontology-based biomedical applications.

**Results** We developed mOWL, a Python library for machine learning
with ontologies formalized in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). mOWL
implements ontology embedding methods that map information contained
in formal knowledge bases and ontologies into vector spaces while
preserving some of the properties and relations in ontologies, as well
as methods to use these embeddings for similarity computation,
deductive inference and zero-shot learning. We demonstrate mOWL on the
knowledge-based prediction of protein–protein interactions using the
gene ontology and gene–disease associations using phenotype
ontologies.
