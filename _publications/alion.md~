Ontologies play an important role in sharing and reusing knowledge. Several ontologies have been
developed to describe a particular domain but from different perspectives from communities of developers
and users. This has led to the existence of multiple ontologies covering the same or a different domain
with varying degrees of variability. Ontology Alignment is typically used to identify correspondences
between semantically related elements of two or more ontologies in order to address this problem.
We propose A-LIOn a system that learns alignments by combining lexical and semantic approaches
as well as machine learning. The system utilizes OWL EL reasoning for negative sampling which is
iteratively used to inform the correction of the learning of the alignments. We demonstrate that A-LIOn
produces alignments that are coherent with respect to OWL EL.
